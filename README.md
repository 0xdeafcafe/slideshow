slideshow
===

Simple slideshow app written in C#.NET. Enter the path to search for files in, and hit `Gooooooo`. Valid image 
formats are `jpg`, `jpeg`, and `png`. Images will cycle every 1800 ms. Doesn't run in full-screen, you can snap 
it, resize it, and full-screen it. Unlike those fucking annoying slideshow apps. Example below:
